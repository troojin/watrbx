# setup
**this project uses the fileinfo php extension, make sure to install it**

copy .env.example and rename it to .env (fill it out)

run `composer install` (we use a lot of composer packages)

**make sure you add the schema in schema.sql** (no migration system yet, sorry)

and make sure you add this to your nginx config
```
location / {  
	try_files $uri $uri/ /index.php$is_args$query_string;  
} 
```
apache will be done one day

# render deployment
if Render native build fails (often due to missing PHP extensions), deploy with Docker using the included files:

- `render.yaml`
- `Dockerfile`

This image installs required extensions from `composer.json` (`dom`, `mbstring`, `soap`) and starts the app with:

```bash
php -S 0.0.0.0:$PORT -t public
```
